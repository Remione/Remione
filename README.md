"Who coded this like a pig" 👀

Hello to everyone. 
Started learning Python 2 years ago, did some application voluntarily for my job. When i showed my first working and functional self-coded application to a developper friend, his reaction was "Who coded this like a pig". 😒
But i kept learning and doing some project for myself.
Some months ago, started with ESP32 and MicroPython which is challenging for me, but passionating. 👍
